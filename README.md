## Description

_This is a detailed chocolate chip cookie recipe based on the example provided in the Epicodus Wk 1 Tuesday Lesson. It has been created from scratch and not copied. The purpose of the recipe is to practice the use of Markdown, as well as Git commands in VS Code. It is **not** recommended to actually attempt making or consuming this recipe, as the list of ingredients and baking process is intentially absurd and just for fun._
